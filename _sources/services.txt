Caliper services
================================

Caliper comes with a number of optional modules (*services*) that
provide measurement data or processing and data recording
capabilities. The flexible combination and configuration of these
services allows you to quickly assemble recording solutions for a wide
range of usage scenarios.

You can enable the services required for your measurement with the
``CALI_SERVICES_ENABLE`` configuration variable, e.g.::

  export CALI_SERVICES_ENABLE=event:recorder:trace

to create event-triggered context traces for an application.

The following sections describe the available service modules and
their configuration.


Aggregate
--------------------------------

The `aggregate` service accumulates aggregation attributes (e.g., time
durations) of snapshots with a similar `key`, creating a profile.

.. envvar:: CALI_AGGREGATE_KEY

   Colon-separated list of attributes that form the aggregation key
   (see below).

   Default: Empty (all attributes without the ``ASVALUE`` storage
   property are key attributes).

.. envvar:: CALI_AGGREGATE_ATTRIBUTES

   Colon-separated list of aggregation attributes. The aggregate
   service aggregates values of aggregation attributes from all input
   snapshots with similar aggregation keys. Note that only attributes
   with the ``ASVALUE`` storage property can be aggregation
   attributes.

   Default: ``time.inclusive.duration`` (Generates event-triggered
   time profiles, if `event` and `timestamp` services are enabled)

Aggregation key
................................

The aggregation key defines for which attributes separate (aggregate)
snapshot records will be kept. That is, the aggregate service will
generate an aggregate snapshot record for each unique combination of
key values found in the input snapshots.  The values of the
aggregation attributes in the input snapshots will be accumulated and
appended to the aggregate snapshot.  The aggregate snapshot records
also include an `aggregate.count` attribute that indicates how many
input snapshots with the given aggregation key were found. Attributes
that are neither aggregation attributes nor part of the aggregation
key will not appear in the aggregate snapshot records.

As an example, consider the following program:

.. code-block:: c++

    #include <caliper/Annotation.h>
    
    void foo(int c) {
        cali::Annotation::Guard
          g( cali::Annotation("function").begin("foo") );

        // ...
    }

    int main()
    {
      { // "A" loop
        cali::Annotation::Guard
          g( cali::Annotation("loop.id").begin("A") );
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
            cali::Annotation("iteration").set(i);            

            foo(1);
            foo(2);
        }
      }

      { // "B" loop
        cali::Annotation::Guard
          g( cali::Annotation("loop.id").begin("B") );
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
            cali::Annotation("iteration").set(i);
            
            foo(1);
        }
      }
    }

Assuming snapshots are generated from the `function` annotation and
the aggregation key contains the `function`, `loop.id`, and
`iteration` attributes, the `aggregate` service will generate the
following aggregate snapshots : ::

    loop.id=A  iteration=0  function=foo  aggregate.count=2
    loop.id=A  iteration=1  function=foo  aggregate.count=2
    loop.id=A  iteration=2  function=foo  aggregate.count=2
    loop.id=B  iteration=0  function=foo  aggregate.count=1
    loop.id=B  iteration=1  function=foo  aggregate.count=1
    loop.id=B  iteration=2  function=foo  aggregate.count=1
    loop.id=B  iteration=3  function=foo  aggregate.count=1

Removing the `iteration` attribute from the aggregation key will
collapse input snapshots with different iteration values into a
single aggregate snapshot: ::

    loop.id=A  function=foo  aggregate.count=6
    loop.id=B  function=foo  aggregate.count=4

Aggregation attributes
................................

The aggregate service accumulates values of aggregation attributes in
input snapshots with similar aggregation keys. Specifically, it
reports the minimum and maximum value, and computes the sum of the
aggregation attributes in the input snapshots. Aggregate snapshots
include `aggregate.(min|max|sum)#attribute-name` attributes with the
minimum, maximum, and sum values for each aggregation attribute,
respectively.

Note that only attributes with the ``ASVALUE`` property can be
aggregation attributes.

Example
................................

The following configuration generates a time profile for the function
annotation separated by loop id. Note: when using
`time.inclusive.duration` as aggregation attribute, we strongly
recommend to include the `event.end` event attributes for all
annotations of interest in the aggregation key (e.g.,
`event.end#function` in the example), or use the default, empty key.

.. code-block:: sh

   $ CALI_SERVICES_ENABLE=aggregate:event:recorder:timestamp \
       CALI_EVENT_TRIGGER=function \
       CALI_AGGREGATE_KEY=event.end#function:loop.id \
         ./test/cali-basic-aggregate
   == CALIPER: Registered aggregation service   
   == CALIPER: Registered event service   
   == CALIPER: Registered recorder service   
   == CALIPER: Registered timestamp service   
   == CALIPER: Initialized
   == CALIPER: aggregate: flushed 4 snapshots.
   == CALIPER: Wrote 57 records.

The resulting file has the following contents: ::

   loop.id=A  event.end#function=foo  aggregate.count=6
     aggregate.min#time.inclusive.duration=25
     aggregate.max#time.inclusive.duration=26
     aggregate.sum#time.inclusice.duration=151
   loop.id=B  event.end#function=foo  aggregate.count=4
     aggregate.min#time.inclusive.duration=25
     aggregate.max#time.inclusive.duration=26
     aggregate.sum#time.inclusice.duration=102
   

Callpath
--------------------------------

The `callpath` service uses libunwind to add callpaths to Caliper
context snapshots. By default, the callpath service provides
call-stack addresses. Set ``CALI_CALLPATH_USE_NAMES=true`` to retrieve
function names on-line. Call-path addresses are provided in the
``callpath.address`` attribute, call-path region names in
``callpath.regname``. Example:

.. code-block:: sh

  $ export CALI_SERVICES_ENABLE=callpath:event:recorder:trace
  $ export CALI_CALLPATH_USE_NAME=true
  $ export CALI_CALLPATH_USE_ADDRESS=true
  $ ./test/cali-basic
  $ cali-query -e --print-attributes=callpath.address:callpath.regname
  $ callpath.address=401207/2aaaac052d5d/400fd9,callpath.regname=main/__libc_start_main/_start

The example shows the ``callpath.address`` and ``callpath.regname``
attributes in Caliper context records.  

.. envvar:: CALI_CALLPATH_USE_NAME=(true|false)
            
   Provide region names for call paths. Incurs higher overhead. Note
   that region names for C++ and Fortran functions are not demangled.
   
   Default: false.

.. envvar:: CALI_CALLPATH_USE_ADDRESS=(true|false)
            
   Record region addresses for call paths.

   Default: true.

.. envvar:: CALI_CALLPATH_SKIP_FRAMES=<number of frames>

   Skip a number of stack frames. This avoids recording stack frames
   within the Caliper library.

   Default: 10

Environment Information
--------------------------------

The environment information (`env`) service collects runtime
environment information at process startup and adds it to the Caliper
context.

Specifically, it collects

 * The process' command line (program name and arguments)
 * Machine type and hostname, and operating system type, release, and
   version
 * Date and time of program start in text form

Moreover, the environment information service can put any environment
variable defined at program start on the Caliper blackboard.

.. envvar:: CALI_ENV_EXTRA=(variable1:variable2:...)

   List of extra environment variables to import.

   Default: empty

Event
--------------------------------

The event trigger service triggers snapshots when attributes are
updated. It is possible to select a list of snapshot-triggering
attributes, or have any attribute update trigger snapshots.
Updates of attributes with the ``CALI_ATTR_SKIP_EVENTS`` property will
never trigger snapshots.

Snapshots triggered by the event service include an attribute which
describes the event that triggered the snapshot, in the following
form: ::

  event.<begin|set|end>#<attribute name>=<value>

For example, a snapshot triggered by the call 
``cali_set_int_byname("my.iteration", 42);`` includes the attribute
`event.set#my.iteration=42` to describe the triggering event.
  
The following example shows the snapshots generated by the example
program in :doc:`usage`:

.. code-block:: sh

                $ export CALI_SERVICES_ENABLE=event:recorder:trace
                $ ./test/cali-basic
                $ cali-query -e 150819-113409_40027_W5Z0mWvoJUyn.cali
                event.begin#initialization=true,cali.snapshot.event.begin=39
                event.end#initialization=true,cali.snapshot.event.end=39,initialization=true
                event.begin#loop=true,cali.snapshot.event.begin=53
                event.set#iteration=0,cali.snapshot.event.set=63,loop=true
                event.set#iteration=1,cali.snapshot.event.set=63,iteration=0,loop=true
                event.set#iteration=2,cali.snapshot.event.set=63,iteration=1,loop=true
                event.set#iteration=3,cali.snapshot.event.set=63,iteration=2,loop=true
                event.end#iteration=3,cali.snapshot.event.end=63,iteration=3,loop=true
                event.end#loop=true,cali.snapshot.event.end=53,loop=true

By setting ``CALI_EVENT_TRIGGER``, we can configure the example to
only trigger snapshot for "iteration" attribute updates:

.. code-block:: sh
                
                $ export CALI_SERVICES_ENABLE=event:recorder:trace
                $ export CALI_EVENT_TRIGGER=iteration
                $ ./test/cali-basic
                $ cali-query -e 150819-113409_40027_W5Z0mWvoJUyn.cali
                event.set#iteration=0,cali.snapshot.event.set=63,loop=true
                event.set#iteration=1,cali.snapshot.event.set=63,iteration=0,loop=true
                event.set#iteration=2,cali.snapshot.event.set=63,iteration=1,loop=true
                event.set#iteration=3,cali.snapshot.event.set=63,iteration=2,loop=true
                event.end#iteration=3,cali.snapshot.event.end=63,iteration=3,loop=true

.. envvar:: CALI_EVENT_TRIGGER=(attribute1:attribute2:...)
            
   List of attributes that trigger measurement snapshots.
   If empty, all user attributes trigger snapshots.

   Default: empty
  
Debug
--------------------------------

The debug service prints an event log on the selected Caliper log
stream. This is useful to debug source-code annotations. Note that you
need to set Caliper's verbosity level to at least 2 to see the log
output.

Example:

.. code-block:: sh

                $ export CALI_SERVICES_ENABLE=debug
                $ export CALI_LOG_VERBOSITY=2
                $ ./test/cali-basic
                == CALIPER: Available services: callpath papi debug event pthread recorder timestamp mpi
                == CALIPER: Registered debug service
                == CALIPER: Initialized
                ...
                == CALIPER: Event: create_attribute (attr = phase)
                == CALIPER: Event: pre_begin (attr = phase)
                == CALIPER: Event: pre_begin (attr = phase)
                == CALIPER: Event: pre_end (attr = phase)
                == CALIPER: Event: pre_begin (attr = phase)
                == CALIPER: Event: create_attribute (attr = iteration)
                == CALIPER: Event: pre_set (attr = iteration)
                == CALIPER: Event: pre_set (attr = iteration)
                == CALIPER: Event: pre_set (attr = iteration)
                == CALIPER: Event: pre_set (attr = iteration)
                == CALIPER: Event: pre_end (attr = iteration)
                == CALIPER: Event: pre_end (attr = phase)
                == CALIPER: Event: pre_end (attr = phase)
                == CALIPER: Event: finish
                == CALIPER: Finished

MPI
--------------------------------

The MPI service records MPI operations and the MPI rank. Use it to
keep track of the program execution spent in MPI. You can select the
MPI functions to track by setting ``CALI_MPI_WHITELIST`` or
``CALI_MPI_BLACKLIST`` filters. By default, all MPI functions are
instrument.

MPI function names are stored in the ``mpi.function`` attribute, and
the MPI rank in the ``mpi.rank`` attribute.

Note that you have to link the `libcaliper-mpiwrap` library with the
application in addition to the regular Caliper libraries to obtain MPI
information.

.. envvar:: CALI_MPI_WHITELIST=(MPI_Fn_1:MPI_Fn_2:...)
            
   List of MPI functions to instrument. If set, only whitelisted
   functions will be instrumented.

.. envvar:: CALI_MPI_BLACKLIST=(MPI_Fn_1:MPI_Fn_2:...)
            
   List of MPI functions that fill be filtered. Note: if both
   whitelist and blacklist are set, only whitelisted functions will
   be instrumented, and the blacklist will be applied to the
   whitelisted functions.

Recorder
--------------------------------

The recorder service writes Caliper I/O records into a file.

You can also set the directory and filename that should be used;
by default, the recorder service will auto-generate a
file name.

.. envvar:: CALI_RECORDER_FILENAME=(stdout|stderr|filename)
            
   File name for context trace. May be set to ``stdout`` or ``stderr``
   to print to the standard output or error streams, respectively.
   
   Default: not set, auto-generates a unique file name.

.. envvar:: CALI_RECORDER_DIRECTORY=(directory name)
            
   Directory to write context trace files to. The directory must exist,
   Caliper does not create it. Default: not set, use current working
   directory.

Textlog
--------------------------------

The textlog service prints a text representation of snapshots to a configurable
output stream. This can be used to print out a log of the program's
progress at runtime.

Currently, text log output can only be triggered by attribute update events.
Therefore, the `event` service must be active as well.
You can select which attribute updates trigger a text log output, define the
output format, and set the output stream (stdout, stderr, or a file name).

The following example prints a text log for the `phase` attribute of the
test application with Caliper's auto-generated format string:

.. code-block:: sh

                $ export CALI_SERVICES_ENABLE=event:textlog:timestamp
                $ export CALI_TEXTLOG_TRIGGER=phase
                $ ./test/cali-basic
                == CALIPER: Registered event trigger service
                == CALIPER: Registered timestamp service
                == CALIPER: Registered text log service
                == CALIPER: Initialized
                phase=main/init                                                       21      
                phase=main/loop                                                       84      
                phase=main                                                            219     
                == CALIPER: Finished
                

.. envvar:: CALI_TEXTLOG_TRIGGER=attr1:attr2:...
            
   Select attributes which trigger a text log output. Note that the `event`
   service must be active in order to trigger snapshots in the first place,
   and the attributes selected here must be in the list of attributes that
   trigger snapshots (defined by `CALI_EVENT_TRIGGER`).

.. envvar:: CALI_TEXTLOG_FORMATSTRING=(formatstring)
            
   Define what to print. The formatstring can contain fields, denoted by
   ``%attribute_name%``, which prints the value of an attribute. Optionally,
   a field can contain a width specification, denoted by ``[width]``, to set
   the minimum width of a field. Any other text is printed verbatim.
   For example, ``Phase: %[32]app.phase% %[6]time.phase.duration%`` writes
   log strings with two fields: the value of the `app.phase` attribute with
   a minimum width of 40 characters, and the value of  `time.phase.duration`
   attribute with a minimum width of 6 characters, respectively. A resulting
   log entry might look like this:

   .. code-block:: sh
                   
      Phase: main/loop                       7018
   
   Default: empty; Caliper will automatically create a format string based on
   the selected trigger attributes.
  
.. envvar:: CALI_TEXTLOG_FILENAME=(stdout|stderr|filename)
            
   File name for the text log. May be set to ``stdout`` or ``stderr``
   to print to the standard output or error streams, respectively.
   
   Default: stdout

Timestamp
--------------------------------

The timestamp service adds a time offset, timestamp, or duration to
context records. Note that timestamps are *not* synchronized between
nodes in a distributed-memory program.

.. envvar:: CALI_TIMER_SNAPSHOT_DURATION=(true|false)
            
   Measure duration (in microseconds) of the context epoch (i.e., the
   time between two consecutive context snapshots). The value will be
   saved in the snapshot record as attribute ``time.duration``.

   Default: false

.. envvar:: CALI_TIMER_OFFSET=(true|false)
            
   Include the time offset (time since program start, in microseconds)
   with each context snapshot. The value will be saved in the snapshot
   record as attribute ``time.offset``.

   Default: false

.. envvar:: CALI_TIMER_TIMESTAMP=(true|false)
            
   Include absolute timestamp (time since UNIX epoch, in seconds) with
   each context snapshot. The value will be saved in the snapshot record
   as attribute ``time.timestamp``.

.. envvar:: CALI_TIMER_INCLUSIVE_DURATION=(true|false)
            
   For snapshots triggered by ``set`` or ``end`` events, calculate the
   duration of the corresponding ``begin-end``, ``set-set``, or
   ``set-end`` phase. The value will be saved in the snapshot record
   as attribute ``time.inclusive.duration``.

   The event service with event trigger information generation needs
   to be enabled for this feature.

   Default: true
  
Trace
--------------------------------

The trace service creates an I/O record for each snapshot. With the
``recorder`` sercice enabled, this will create a snapshot trace file.

The trace service maintains per-thread snapshot buffers. By default,
trace buffers will grow automatically. This behavior can be changed by
setting a *buffer policy*. There are three options:

Grow
    Grow the buffer when it is full. This is the default.

Stop
    Stop recording when the buffer is full.

Flush
    Flush the buffer when it is full and continue recording. Note that 
    buffer flushes can significantly perturb the program's
    performance.

.. envvar:: CALI_TRACE_BUFFER_SIZE

   Size of the trace buffer, in Megabytes. With the `grow` buffer
   policy, this is the size of a trace buffer *chunk*: When the buffer
   is full, another chunk of this size is added. Default: 2 (MiB).

.. envvar:: CALI_TRACE_BUFFER_POLICY

   Sets the trace buffer policy (see above). Either `grow`, `stop`, or
   `flush`. Default: `grow`.
