Caliper: Context Annotation Library (for Performance)
================================================================

Caliper is a generic context annotation system. It serves as an
abstraction layer between applications and performance tools,
providing a clean and easy-to-use interface for application developers
to express application semantics that can be used by tools and
auto-tuners. In addition, Caliper provides performance profiling and
tracing capabilites on its own.

Caliper is available for download on
`github <https://github.com/LLNL/Caliper>`_.
