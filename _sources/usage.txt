Getting started
================================

Caliper provides annotation APIs for marking source-code regions or
exporting arbitrary data in the form of key:value attributes. Caliper
makes this data accessible to tools.

Moreover, Caliper contains built-in *service* modules for basic
measurement and recording tasks.  For example, Caliper can be
configured to trigger *snapshots* of the provided
information. Optionally, measurement data, e.g. timestamps, can be
added to the snapshots. Source-code annotations and Caliper service
modules can be flexibly combined to support a wide range of
performance analysis or monitoring use cases.

Source-code annotations
--------------------------------

Adding Caliper source-code annotations is easy. 

The following example marks "initialization" and "loop" phases in a
C++ code, and exports the main loop's current iteration counter.

.. code-block:: c++
                
    #include <Annotation.h>

    int main(int argc, char* argv[])
    {
        // Mark begin of "initialization" phase
        cali::Annotation
            init_ann = cali::Annotation("initialization").begin();
        // perform initialization tasks
        int count = 4;
        // Mark end of "initialization" phase
        init_ann.end();

        if (count > 0) {
            // Mark begin of "loop" phase. The scope guard will
            // automatically end it at the end of the C++ scope
            cali::Annotation::Guard 
                g_loop( cali::Annotation("loop").begin() );

            // Create "iteration" attribute to export the iteration count
            cali::Annotation iteration_ann("iteration");

            for (int i = 0; i < count; ++i) {
                // Export current iteration count under "iteration"
                iteration_ann.set(i);

                // A Caliper snapshot taken at this point will contain
                // { "loop", "iteration"=<i> }
            }

            // Clear the "iteration" attribute (otherwise, snapshots taken
            // after the loop will still contain the last "iteration" value)
            iteration_ann.end();
        }
    }

See :doc:`api` for examples in C and Fortran.

Caliper-enabled tools will now be able to access the information
provided by the source-code annotations at runtime by taking
snapshots. The source-code annotations also provide hooks to enable
various runtime actions in built-in Caliper service modules, such as
triggering snapshots or writing traces.

Build and link Caliper programs
--------------------------------

To use Caliper, add annotation statements to your program and link it
against the Caliper library. Programs must be linked with the Caliper
runtime (libcaliper) and infrastructure libraries (libcaliper-common). ::
  
    CALIPER_LIBS = -L$(CALIPER_DIR)/lib -lcaliper

See :doc:`link` for more information.

Running Caliper programs
--------------------------------

By default, Caliper annotation commands perform no actions other than
updating a Caliper-internal *blackboard buffer* . However, we can
connect a Caliper-enabled third-party tool to the program, or enable
built-in Caliper "service" modules to take measurements and collect
data.

As an example, Caliper's built-in `trace` configuration profiles
trigger and write snapshots whenever any or specific attributes are
updated, generating a snapshot trace. A configuration profile can be
selected with the `CALI_CONFIG_PROFILE` environment variable:

.. code-block:: sh
                
    $ CALI_CONFIG_PROFILE=thread-trace ./cali-basic
    == CALIPER: Registered pthread service
    == CALIPER: Registered recorder service
    == CALIPER: Registered timestamp service
    == CALIPER: Initialized
    == CALIPER: Wrote 36 records.
    == CALIPER: Finished

With this configuration, Caliper will take a snapshot for each
attribute update performed by the annotation commands, calculate the
time spent in each of the annotated phases, and write the results in
form of a snapshot trace to a `.cali` file in the current working
directory.

Analyzing Data
--------------------------------

Use the `cali-query` tool to filter, aggregate, or print the recorded
traces. For example, the following command will show us the time spent
in the "initialization" phase, in the entire "loop" phase, and in each
iteration of the example program: 

.. code-block:: sh
                
    $ ls *.cali
    160219-095419_5623_LQfNQTNgpqdM.cali
    $ cali-query -e \
          --print-attributes=iteration:loop:initialization:time.inclusive.duration \
          160219-095419_5623_LQfNQTNgpqdM.cali
    initialization=true,time.inclusive.duration=202
    iteration=0,loop=true,time.inclusive.duration=51
    iteration=1,loop=true,time.inclusive.duration=24
    iteration=2,loop=true,time.inclusive.duration=17
    iteration=3,loop=true,time.inclusive.duration=24
    loop=true,time.inclusive.duration=211

Where to go from here?
--------------------------------

Caliper allows a great amount of flexibility and control in utilizing
source-code annotations. Much of Caliper's functionality is
implemented by built-in "services", which can be enabled or disabled
as needed. Refer to the :doc:`services` section to learn about
functionality they provide.  Finally, the :doc:`api` section in the
documentation provides reference documentation for Caliper's C, C++,
and Fortran annotation APIs.
